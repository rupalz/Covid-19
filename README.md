# Covid-19
Covid-19 has been widespread in India despite the efforts of suppressing it. India has taken several countermeasures, yet there are no significant signs of improvement. Such is the case due to the high transmission rate. This study aims to visualize the main cause of the difference in the severity of cases among the states of India. 

The dataset comprises the following characteristics that were concluded to conduct a comparative:
1.Time of the recorded dates
2.State/UnionTerritory
3.Confirmed Cases
4.Death rates per state
5.Recovery rate per state
6.Confirmed Foreign cases (COVID cases brought to India from foreign countries)
7.Confirmed Indian National cases (Domestic COVID cases)

Python provides a vast set of analytical tools that have been utilized to analyze the dataset. The selected libraries used are​ Numpy,​ Pandas, ​Scipy, ​Matplotlib pyplot, Seaborn​.  

Statistical Analysis was also conducted using the IBM SPSS software on the early phase of covid ie. March, is compared with the active covid cases all over India. The visualization model clearly showed that the major states that were most affected were the states that have major metropolitan cities.
